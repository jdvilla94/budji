# Why this app?
I used google sheets to manage my expenses, and I wanted something thats more visual, and easier to view on my phone. So using the 50/30/20 rule,  I created a view that can add individual expenses
and each expense has specific categories to choose from. After adding said expenses, you can view them in a calendar aspect, or in a graph aspect. Each gives a detailed description, and allows you
to have an easier time managing expenses, saving for trips, etc.

# What can I improve?
I can make the UI more pleasant and user friendly. First page has a smily face, I wanted to incorporate varuious faces to dictate if you are doing good or bad, are you over on certain categories, 
if so it will send you a face and remind you to chagne you habits. Also everyone likes things to be automated, so perhaps I can integrate the Plaid API so it can get your info from you bank, 
parse the data, and put it in accordingly, insterad of you doing it manually.
